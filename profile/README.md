# SureBack - Marketing Rewards Systems

Based on research, food and drink content on social media is most likely to influence a customer's purchasing decision. Recommendations from friends and nano-micro influencers are also among the highest factors in influencing consumer purchasing decisions. To take advantage of the potential of social media, culinary businesses may have tried implementing a rewards system for customers who promote the business on Instagram, but this can be a time-consuming and tedious task. Recalculating each reward's percentage, recording expenses, and checking each customer's promotional uploads individually to ensure they are effective can take up a lot of time and energy, especially when the business is focused on running the day-to-day operations.

That's where SureBack comes in! SureBack is an iOS application to help culinary businesses who want to track and record their customers' Instagram story promotion that has fair and automatic reward distribution after 24 hours along with its report.
